Welcome to Trinary University

This Simulation of Trinary University  is based on "The Principles of the Trinary Universe", both written by me, Jeffrey Scott Flesher, I sign my name Flesh, and go by that term. 

This Simulator uses Unreal Engines Game Engine, and Physics Simulator, but this Simulation is based on the Science of Johannes Kepler, Sir Isaac Newton, Nikola Tesla, the Torah, and the Bible. 

You need to know about the Julian Calender, Newton was born on 25 December 1642, the Gregorian Calendar change it to 4 January 1643 then they removed 10 days, so the End of Time is now 14 January 2061 on my 100th birthday. Science since Einstein, till the present day, is the only Science taught in School due to the fact that Newton's work was released to public domain around the same time, and religious people ban Newton for proving that Jesus Christ was inserted into the Torah during the fourth Century, exposing the lie behind Religion, and making Newton the Antichrist, as such, few know anything about this science. 

The University is based on teaching concepts without using Theories, which is not a way of explaining a fact, but the opposite of what a fact is, which is the truth. 

Read the Writing on the Wall, you will find a Speaker pad that will use a Text-to-Speach computer voice to read it for you but read along because the words I use, are not always spelled the way you think they should be, you get IQ points for listening as long as you read along, it is activated by proximity and will start over if you walk away from the speaker pad, then back in, and if you get a question wrong, you will be subtracted IQ points, or given a Sin, and your health can be taken away if you get to close to hazards, you can find things to improve your health, and increase your IQ, and decrease your Sins.
