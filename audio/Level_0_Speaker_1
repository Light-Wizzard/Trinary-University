Welcome to Trinary University

This is a Simulation of Trinary University, based on "The Principles of the Trinary Universe", written by the same person who wrote this Simulator, my name is Jeffrey Scott Flesher, I sign my name Flesh, and go by that term. 

This Simulator uses Unreal Engine, which is a Game Engine, and Physics Simulator, but this Simulation is based on the Science of Johannes Kepler, Sir Isaac Newton, Nikola Tesla, the Torah, and the Bible. 

Newton was born on 25 December 1642, the Gregorian Calendar change it to 4 January 1643 then they removed 10 days, and I was born on 14 January 1961, so I can only talk about this time frame, but the Science of this period of time since Einstein, till the present day, only Einstein based Science Fiction was taught in School due to the fact that Newton's work was released to public domain around the same time, and religious people ban Newton for proving that Jesus Christ was inserted into the Torah during the fourth Century, making him the Antichrist, as such, few know anything about this science. 

The University is based on teaching concepts without using Theories, which is not a way of explaining a fact, but the opposite of what a fact is, which is the truth. 

Read the Writing on the Wall, you will find a Speaker that will use a Text-to-Speach computer voice to read it for you but read along because the words I use, are not always spelled the way you think they should be. 

This Simulator will give you IQ points for listening to the Speaker, as long as you read along, it is activated by proximity and will start over if you walk away from the speaker post, then back in, and if you get a question wrong, you will be subtracted IQ points, or given a Sin, depending on the question, and your health can be taken away if you get to close to some hazards, you can find things to improve your health, and increase your IQ, and decrease your Sins. 

Newton believes God is the Light without Darkness found inside every Atom in the Universe, this is not the same God that any Religion believes in, and he calculated the End of Time will be on 14 January 2061.

Do you believe in the God that Newton said was the Force of Gravity in all his Equations?

Yes No
