# Trinary University

This is an Unreal Engine Simulator (Game) based on the Trinary University, a 666-page Physics Ph.D. textbook titled ["The Principles of Trinary Universe"](https://github.com/Light-Wizzard/The-Principles-Of-The-Trinary-Universe/blob/master/misc/the.principles.of.the.trinary.universe.pdf).

I am using a free account, and cannot upload the project to this account unless I upgrade to a paid account, I can upload the Simulator executable so you can play the game.

I started this in December of 2022, and hope to have it finished early next year.

This Simulator is based on the Science of Johannes Kepler, Sir Isaac Newton, and Nikola Teals, and not Albert Einstein since no one uses his Science, or can use it since Einstein removed God from his Alternate Universe in an Alternate Reality, so unless you live in one of those that does not include God, then your grasp on Physics is insane since the Torah and Bible define God as all Light without Darkness, and we know that is found inside Atoms, thus Einstein has no Atoms, and why he denounced it in 1942 to keep Tesla from laughing at him.

This Simulator is about understanding the End of Time that will happen once our Magnetosphere hits 0, and according to NASA it is decaying at a constant rate of 5% per century, and Newton stated this was why the Calendar was reset to 0, and then calculated it would be the End of Time on 14 January 2061, as you know the Calendar was changed from the Julian calendar that had Newtonâ€™s birthdate on 25 December 1642 changing around 1666 during his lifetime to 4 January 1643 then they removed 10 days making it the 14th, and this event will happen when the Binary Star known as Christ but called Sirius, aligns with the Great Pyramid, that is at 6:32 PST for me, but varies around the world, this is when our Atmosphere vents into Space for 1/137th the diameter in time, or 6.66 minutes, just like the Torah told you.
